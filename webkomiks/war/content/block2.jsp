	<h4>Comics</h4>
	A comic	denotes a hybrid medium having verbal side of its vocabulary tightly 
	tied to its visual side in order to convey narrative or 
	information only, the latter in case of non-fiction comics, 
	seeking synergy by using both visual (non-verbal) and 
	verbal side in interaction.
